<section class="intro">
    <p>Domain Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) and Event Sourcing (ES) have been around for a couple of decades already and have failed to go mainstream for a variety of reasons.</p>
    <p>DDD, CQRS and ES complement eachother perfectly and encourage and enable rapid prototyping of software applications that are very close to the business' needs without huge abstractions.</p>
    <p>This book covers the basics of DDD, CQRS and ES and lays forth a batteries-included approach (and a small framework) which lets you get up and running very quickly.</p>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>When will the book be published?</dt>
        <dd>The book should be published in the first half of 2019. Work began in earnest in 2018 and a framework is currently being extracted from the book sample code to make the examples easier to follow.</dd>
        <dt>What language is used in the book?</dt>
        <dd>The book mostly uses Go for the reference implementation however any language with a concept of lazy interables (channels in Go, Enumerable in Ruby, and lots of other languages) will be a great fit for this approach. A Ruby implementation is in the works to help share the message that this is an <em>approach</em>, not only a framework</dd>
        <dt>What kinds of application can be written with this approach?</dt>
        <dd>Any application where the bussiness rules are complex enough to warrant including domain driven design. Web applications are a great example, so are business engines, customer-service portals, e-commerce applications and even native mobile applications.</dd>
